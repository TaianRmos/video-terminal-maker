Very simple project to display a video in a terminal-type aspect


Hi there ! 

If you're looking for very simple and stupid tool for making videos display in the terminal and loop around for no reason, then you're in the right place.

To get started, you just have to put a video in the <code>/video</code> folder then launch the <code>video_maker.bat</code> file and everything will follow along !
> Note: You need a Python3 installed on your computer to run the program so make sure it's installed correctly.

You also have the possibility to create a <code>.vbs</code> file that launches the program when it's closed. It's useless but was made as a joke at the beginning and I decided to let it in since it's only an option.

One of the option in that <code>.vbs</code> file is to loop forever and get duplicated each time. When you do that, the file is detected as a virus on any other machine and gets deleted instantly if you try to move it on another machine. So now you have a new python <code>.exe</code> file to create the <code>.vbs</code> script directly on the machine instead of copying it.

Have fun !
